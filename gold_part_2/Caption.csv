Irvine vanished while attempting to conquer the world‚Äôs tallest peak in 1924, along with climbing partner and renowned mountaineer George Mallory. The mystery of whether they reached the summit before their deaths has intrigued climbers and historians for decades.

Back in 1996, @NASAHubble revealed the hourglass shape of this young planetary nebula located about 8,000 light-years away. In previous images taken from the ground, the nebula looked like a pair of large outer rings with a smaller central one, but the finer details could not be seen.

Planetary nebulae are created by the death of Sun-like stars: the star collapses to form a dense and hot white dwarf star. At the same time, the dying star throws off its outer layers of material, forming an elaborate cloud of gas and dust known as a planetary nebula. This isn‚Äôt an uncommon phenomenon, and yet, this ‚Äúeye‚Äù star is a little unique: it should be at the center of the nebula, but it‚Äôs off center.

Hubble also revealed other new and unexpected features in the nebula. For example, there is a pair of intersecting elliptical rings in the central region, which appear to be the rims of a smaller hourglass. There are also the intricate patterns of the etchings on the hourglass walls. There are a few possible explanations for the arc-like etchings ‚Äì for instance, they could be the remnants of shells ejected from the star when it was younger.

This picture was composed of three separate images taken by Hubble‚Äôs Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 in the light of ionized nitrogen (represented by red), hydrogen (green), and doubly ionized oxygen (blue).

Image description: This nebula has an interesting appearance: what looks like a turquoise blue eye stares right at you from the center of a red-orange hourglass-like shape made from two interlocking circles ‚Äì like a Venn diagram turned on its side.

Have no fear: what might look like a nightmarish beast throwing its head back in an angry red sea is just a pillar of gas and dust. The Cone Nebula is 2,500 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros. This image, captured by @NASAHubble, shows the upper 2.5 light-years of the nebula; the entire nebula is 7 light-years long. Monstrous pillars of cold gas like the Cone are common in large regions of star birth. Astronomers believe the pillars are incubators for developing stars.

Over millions of years, radiation from hot, young stars (located beyond the top of the image) has slowly eroded the nebula. This process causes the hydrogen gas to glow, which produces the red halo of light seen around the pillar. A similar process occurs on a much smaller scale to gas surrounding a single star, forming the bow-shaped arc seen near the upper left side of the Cone. Eventually, only the densest regions of the Cone will be left. Inside these regions, stars and planets may form.

Image description: Against a dramatic red backdrop, a dark pillar of gas and dust stretches upward, its top illuminated by the reflected light of nearby stars. Some stars are sprinkled across the top of the image. There are also a few stars dotting the bottom of the pillar.

On Aug. 31, 2012, the Sun let out quite a burp. A long filament of solar material erupted out from the Sun's atmosphere, or corona, into space. This coronal mass ejection (CME) was captured in different ultraviolet light wavelengths by our Solar Dynamics Observatory, a spacecraft that studies solar activity and space weather. This photo combines those images to give us a detailed view of the solar event.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This CME traveled at over 900 miles per second (1450 kps), connecting with Earth's magnetic environment. When the particles released during a CME interact with gases in Earth‚Äôs magnetosphere, beautiful displays of light in the sky appear: auroras.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Auroras happen more often and more strongly when the Sun is at its peak activity level in its 11-year cycle, called solar maximum. You may have guessed that we‚Äôre currently in this peak activity period, given we‚Äôve been able to see auroras several times this year. If you scroll back through our feed, you‚Äôll see a few photos of them.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
We‚Äôll be sure to let you know when there‚Äôs another great opportunity to see an aurora. In the meantime, here are some viewing tips to keep in mind for the next time.

1. Check the weather forecast. You‚Äôll need clear skies to best see the phenomenon.‚Å£

2. Go to a safe, dark location. Strong auroras can be seen even in big cities, but the best views will be in areas with little or no light pollution.‚Å£

3. Be patient! While displays can last all night, sometimes they are much shorter-lived, and they can vary in brightness throughout the night.‚Å£

Check out the link in our bio for more tips!‚Å£

When supernova remnant SN 1006 first appeared in the sky in 1006 C.E., it was far brighter than Venus and visible during the daytime for weeks. From that moment on, it occupied the hearts of astronomers all over the world; it has been studied from the ground and from space many times.‚Å£

 ‚Å£
Scientists believe SN 1006 is a Type Ia supernova. This class of supernova is caused when a white dwarf never lets another star go: either it pulls too much mass from a companion star and explodes, or it merges with another white dwarf and explodes. Understanding Type Ia supernovas is especially important because astronomers use observations of these explosions in distant galaxies as mileposts to mark the expansion of the universe.‚Å£

Saturn ice moon Mimas wears its history on its surface. The tiny moon ‚Äì only 247 miles (397 km) across ‚Äì is covered in impact craters dating from the turbulent beginnings of our solar system.
 
Its most distinguishing feature is a giant impact crater named Herschel (not shown here), after the English astronomer who discovered Mimas in 1789. Shock waves from the Herschel impact may have caused the fractures, also called chasmata, on the opposite side of Mimas.
 
Puzzlingly, Mimas appears to be frozen solid. Mimas is closer to Saturn and has a much more elongated orbit than Enceladus, another of Saturn‚Äôs icy moons, so it should have more tidal heating than Enceladus. Yet Enceladus has geysers of water, which implies internal heat, while Mimas has one of the most heavily cratered surfaces in the solar system, which suggests a frozen surface that has lasted long enough to preserve all those craters.
 
This paradox has prompted the ""Mimas Test"" ‚Äì any theory that claims to explain Enceladus‚Äô partially thawed water must also explain Mimas‚Äô entirely frozen water.

To date, these galaxies have only grazed each other, but there is some possible evidence of the collision visible in this image.

The Chandra data (purple) shows the diffuse X-ray emission and young stars in this star cluster, Cygnus OB2. Infrared data from Spitzer (red, green, blue, and cyan) reveals more young stars and the cooler dust and gas throughout the region.

In a crowded environment like this, there is a lot of high-energy radiation made by stars and planets. Together, X-rays and intense ultraviolet light can destroy planetary disks and systems in the process of forming.

This haze represents diffuse X-ray emissions, and young stars, detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Surrounding the purple haze is a mottled, streaky, brick orange cloud. Another cloud resembling a tendril of gray smoke stretches from our lower left to the center of the image. These clouds represent relatively cool dust and gas observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. Although the interwoven clouds cover most of the image, the thousands of stars within the cluster shine through. The lower-mass stars present as tiny specks of light.

Since its discovery in 1987, this supernova has fascinated astronomers with its spectacular light show. Located in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, it was the nearest supernova explosion observed in hundreds of years and the best opportunity yet for astronomers to study the phases before, during, and after the death of a star.

This supernova has been studied by @NASAHubble, @nasachandraxray, and ALMA, a powerful array of 66 antennas, for over 30 years. Here are a few things they showed us, so slow down, sit down, it's new:

- Hubble studies revealed that the dense ring of gas around the supernova (visible at the very center of the image) has a diameter of about a light-year and glows in optical light. The ring was there at least 20,000 years before the star exploded. A flash of ultraviolet light from the explosion energized the gas in the ring, making it glow for decades.

- Chandra data showed an expanding ring of X-ray emission that had been steadily getting brighter from 1993 to 2013. The blast wave from the original explosion has been bursting through and heating the ring of gas surrounding the supernova, producing X-rays.

- Beginning in 2012, astronomers used ALMA to observe the glowing remains of the supernova, studying how the remnant is actually making vast amounts of new dust. A portion of this dust will make its way into interstellar space and may become the building blocks of future stars and planets in another system. These observations also suggest that dust in the early universe likely formed from similar supernova explosions.

Image description: Clouds of gas and dust in shades of red cover the top of the image and a little bit of the bottom. Right in the middle is Supernova 1987a, the remnant of an exploded star. The site of the supernova is surrounded by an illuminated pinkish ring. Two faint outer rings are also visible. Stars and galaxies shine throughout, giving off red and blue light.

X-ray images from our Chandra X-ray Observatory helped astronomers confirm that most of the oxygen in the universe is synthesized in massive stars. So, everybody say ""thank you"" to supernova remnants (SNRs) like this one, which has enough oxygen for thousands of solar systems.

Supernova remnants are, naturally, the remains of exploded stars. They're extremely important for understanding our galaxy. If it weren't for SNRs, there would be no Earth, no plants, animals, or people. This is because all the elements heavier than iron were made in a supernova explosion, so the only reason we find these elements on Earth or in our solar system ‚Äî or any other extrasolar planetary system ‚Äî is because those elements were formed during a supernova.

Some particles trapped in the magnetic field are accelerated into Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere where they excite nitrogen and oxygen molecules and release photons of light ‚Äì the aurora.

Since the space station became operational in November 2000, crew members have produced hundreds of thousands of images of Earth and natural events like auroras. Their photographs record how the planet changes over time, allowing scientists to study phenomena, monitor disasters, and direct response on the ground.

Surrounded by sweeping clouds of dust are the Seven Sisters. Also known as the Pleiades, this star cluster is 445 light-years away in the constellation Taurus. There are clearly way more than seven stars in this image ‚Äì this star cluster actually contains over a thousand stars loosely bound by gravity. However, a handful of these stars are brighter than their siblings, standing out visually.
 
This image was captured by the infrared camera on our now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope. The colors in the picture correspond to infrared wavelengths: light with a wavelength of 4.5 microns is blue; light of 8 microns is green; and light of 24 microns is red.
 
The Sisters are also visible from the ground. For best viewing, find them with a pair of binoculars in November through March. You‚Äôll find them toward the south in the Northern Hemisphere and toward the north in the Southern Hemisphere.

If you were living in this ‚Äúsuper star‚Äù cluster, you might see a sky full of hundreds of stars, each as bright as the full moon.
¬†
This is @NASAWebb‚Äôs look at Westerlund 1, one of the closest clusters of its kind. Super star clusters are young and contain more than 10,000 times the mass of the Sun packed into a small volume. Westerlund 1 is the most massive yet identified in our galaxy, with 50,000 to 100,000 times the mass of the Sun contained within a region less than six light-years across. Still considered an open cluster now, someday it will evolve into a globular cluster‚Äîa roughly spherical, tightly packed collection of old stars bound together by gravity.
¬†
Super star clusters are one of the most extreme environments in which stars and planets can form. Because our galaxy is past its peak of star formation, and because stars live relatively short lives, only a few of these clusters still exist to give us clues to that past era.
¬†
Westerlund 1 has a large, dense, and diverse population of evolved, massive stars. It contains so many massive stars that in a timespan of less than 40 million years, it‚Äôll be the site of more than 1500 supernovas. This cluster is a natural laboratory for the study of extreme stellar physics, helping us learn how the most massive stars in our galaxy live and die, and how stellar winds, supernovae, and other ejected material affect star formation within their environment.

This composite image shows a cluster in the center of the Flame Nebula, found about 1,400 light-years from Earth. Research suggests that the stars at the center of this cluster are about 200,000 years old, while those on the outskirts are about 1.5 million years of age.

We usually see Earth‚Äôs Moon in shades of gray, but here in this composite photo made from images captured by our Galileo spacecraft, it‚Äôs a riot of reds, oranges, and blues. And sure, it‚Äôs pretty, but that‚Äôs not the (only) reason we color images.

The unusual colors in this photograph help scientists study what the Moon‚Äôs soil is made of. Areas appearing red generally correspond to the lunar highlands, while blue to orange shades indicate the ancient volcanic lava flow of a mare, or lunar sea. Bluer mare areas contain more titanium than the orange regions do. The deep blue patch on the right is Mare Tranquillitatis, and it‚Äôs richer in titanium than Mare Serenitatis, a slightly smaller circular area to the upper left of Mare Tranquillitatis. Finally, the small purple areas found near the center are deposits formed by explosive volcanic eruptions.

The solid-state imaging system on Galileo captured 15 images of the Moon through three color filters while the spacecraft passed through the Earth-Moon system on Dec. 8, 1992. When this view was obtained, the spacecraft was 262,000 miles (425,000 kilometers) from the Moon and 43,000 miles (69,000 kilometers) from Earth. Galileo continued on to its main mission: studying Jupiter. It orbited the planet for almost eight years, made close passes by all of the planet's major moons, and ended its mission by intentionally crashing into Jupiter on Sept. 21, 2003.

While this image won‚Äôt give you a luxurious bubble bath, meditating on all its colors can be just as relaxing.

Image description: The Moon is awash in shades of red, blue, and orange. The top portion is orange, while the bottom is red, and the middle is blue. The edges of each area are jagged, and some colored portions surround others. There is a very vibrant blue area right of center.

To get a sense, Dianna has spent the last year and a half in her room, unable to watch tv or read a book or spend time with friends. 

She cannot walk or take care of herself. She can brush her teeth and feed herself, but not much more than that. We can cuddle and hold hands, but sometimes that‚Äôs too much for her. It‚Äôs so removed from normal life, and so much worse than you could ever imagine. 

It‚Äôs hard to share these things, because I fear people will blame me or blame her for not treating her properly, for not taking this medication or that supplement, or following such and such a protocol. Or worse yet, suggesting that all she needs is to get up and go for a walk. 

Even on this post, people will say those things. 

But there‚Äôs no consistent treatment or even diagnostics at this point.

I go to Dianna and Kyle's place every week to make some of Dianna meals and help Kyle with anything he needs. I have not spoken to Dianna in a few months due to her being weak. I come in the room, drop off her food, we give each other a little wave, and then I leave.

Summer of 2023, we were definitely speaking with Dianna more. I felt like I was able to speak with her every couple days, and there were even some good laughs. Since Autumn 2023, Dianna's crashes have been rough. So now, she rests more, and communicates in a way that hopefully costs less energy.

Thank you so much everyone. Thank you for being here to help get her better.

Though it‚Äôs been a hard year for Dianna, we would still like to give a little celebration to the fact that the Physics Girl channel just hit 3 million subscribers! 

Dianna is still very sick, and in bed. However, her channel has continued to grow and hang on in her absence. Dianna is not sure when she will get better, and we‚Äôve all been worried about the future of Physics Girl. Knowing the channel is reaching so many people is great news.

Congratulations to Dianna, the team, and a huge thank you to all Physics Girl subscribers and supporters! Youtube allowed Dianna to do science communication the way she wanted to. And it was there we reached out when she needed help. She hopes to one day be uploading another science video for everyone.

Health Update ‚Äî
For the past 2 or more months, Dianna has been dealing with a very heavy crash from her chronic fatigue sydrome. As we know, these crashes keep her physically restricted, but equally as painful is the brain fog she experiences from the mental fatigue. From what we understand working with her doctor, these crashes are to be expected, and expected to be long. So though it‚Äôs hard for all of us to stay positive when it seems like she‚Äôs barely getting better, it‚Äôs important to remember that long set backs are a part of the slow recovery.

I(Levi, Dianna‚Äôs editor) make Dianna‚Äôs day meals Monday through Friday and I have not seen her in months. I give the meals to Kyle and he takes them to her as she is too weak to respond to anyone. I tell this story just to illustrate what it‚Äôs like here and how it‚Äôs still a lot of Dianna laying down trying to stay quiet. Sometimes I leave and come back and it‚Äôs surreal to see that she‚Äôs still like this in the thick of the disease. The GOOD news is for about the past week or 2, Kyle has been telling me she‚Äôs feeling slightly better. They believe she is slowly moving out of this crash, and they are both feeling more hopeful.

Dianna‚Äôs mom visits as often as she can. And we often express to each other our gratitude for all the online support. These month long ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù or ‚Äúsetbacks‚Äù are a reminder of how slow and long this process is and how none of it would be doable without the help. Dianna is very saddened to imagine she may be like this for 5, or 10, or more years. But we all feel like at least she can have something of a shot at a normal life thanks to all the help received.

Thank you so much everyone. Stay tuned for another bigger health update on the Youtube channel soon. If you'd like to support Dianna during her recovery, you can do so at - patreon.com/physicsgirl

It's been over a year since she got sick and she will still crash from any minor mental or physical stress. These crashes are the result from her severe MCAS and ME/CFS.

I started helping Kyle and Dianna full-time here a couple months ago, and it's surreal to see her state. I think when you're not around it, it's easy for the time to pass, or to assume the time goes by relatively easy from her bedroom. But it doesn't. 

Dianna still doesn't consume anything that is potentially overstimulating for her mind. She doesn't watch movies, read books, or listen to music. She's able to speak more throughout the day than she used to, and she develops little funny sentences or short songs in her head. But other than that, you're looking at it. These pictures are the exact place she has been laying since January, unable to even get up and use the bathroom.

Thank you everyone so much for the kind messages and checking in. The support and love is overwhelming.¬†

I just don't know how to respond. I am...very sick.¬†

My brain works at 20% capacity a few minutes a day. I can barely move or talk. The rest of the time, I lie here with my eyes closed in a quiet dark room, no music, no reading, no phone. I count breaths, meditate, repeat mantras to soothe my fears. Sometimes I succeed.¬†

I have severe MCAS. (And severe MECFS, POTS, SIBO, and a lower gut infection, that have been diagnosed so far.) 

The MCAS is brutal. I get dizziness, nausea, and chest pain from everything. Every food I eat, fragrance I smell, organic cotton sheets that have been boiled with no detergent, all my meds (that are supposed to help MCAS). I can't wear clothes, I can't use toothpaste, Kyle has to boil hypoallergenic baby wipes so I can ""bathe"" without getting rashes. This disease is truly horrible.¬†

(Dianna's editor) - It's great that there are solutions like this to help Dianna get what she needs to help her in her recovery. And she genuinely looks better than she did earlier in the year. I can interact with her for a couple minutes a couple times a day, as apposed to her and I exchanging only a couple words a month like we were in March. But, with all that said, she is still daily bed-ridden and has a long road ahead of her. Many people ask daily if there are any health updates, and unfortunately, it's a very long and slow process with not a lot of progress. I have started helping Kyle care-take for Dianna full time, and being here is very surreal. She is still very very sick, but we are staying hopeful. And none of it would be possible without the online support. I'll give more updates whenever I can. Thanks everyone.

Prior to the release of AutoCAD in 1982, engineering drawings were all done by hand using different grade pencils, erasers, T-squares and set squares.

Even after all the manual labor, if a change was required, the engineers and toolmakers had to start from scratch and make the sketches all over again. Nowadays, architecture designers and other drafters are mainly just clicking their mouse and keyboard and not hunched over on a giant desk wondering if any changes will be made to their final drafts.

In the middle of a game, Waddell would disappear to chase fire trucks. He was easily distracted, so opposing fans would bring puppies, which would have Waddell running over to play with them.

American sportswriter and baseball historian Lee Allen wrote that in 1903, Waddell was ‚Äúsleeping in a firehouse at Camden, New Jersey, and ended it tending bar in a saloon in Wheeling, West Virginia. In between those events, he won 22 games for the Philadelphia Athletics, [...] toured the nation in a melodrama called The Stain of Guilt, courted, married, and became separated from May Wynne Skinner of Lynn, Massachusetts, saved a woman from drowning, accidentally shot a friend through the hand, and was bitten by a lion.‚Äù

It should be noted that Waddell was incapable of memorizing his lines for his part in The Stain of Guilt, so he was allowed to improvise his lines in every show. The play went on to critical acclaim.

In 1905, Waddell shared a room with baseball catcher Ossee Schreckengost who refused to continue sharing the room unless there was a clause in Waddell‚Äôs contract that forbade him from eating crackers in bed. It should be noted that it was common for players to share the same bed in hotel rooms while on the road. That same year, Waddell missed the World Series after injuring his shoulder while trying to destroy a straw hat.

However, he went on to win a Triple Crown in pitching. If the Cy Young award had existed during this time, Waddell would have won it over Cy Young himself.

He died of tuberculosis at the age of 37 on April Fool‚Äôs Day, 1914.

I‚Äôll admit, I didn‚Äôt really know much about Kamala‚Äôs backstory, so I did some digging and here‚Äôs what I learned.

Her father, Donald J. Harris, was born in Jamaica and came to the U.S. to get his Phd in Economics. He served as a professor at Stanford University from 1972 to 1988. He is best known for his post-Keynesian ideas on economic growth. 

Her mother, Shamala Gopalan, hailed from India and came to Berkeley to study nutrition and endocrinology. She received her PhD in 1964. Her research focused on trying to find a cure for breast cancer. 

After 8 years of marriage, Kamala‚Äôs parents got a divorce. In her memoir, Kamala wrote, ‚ÄúIt was hard on both of them. I think, for my mother, the divorce represented a kind of failure she had never considered.‚Äù After a fierce custody battle, Kamala and her sister, Maya, were raised mostly be their mother. 

‚ÄúMy mother, who raised me and my sister, was a proud woman. She was a brown woman. She was a woman with a heavy accent. She was a woman who, many times, people would overlook her or not take her seriously. Or because of her accent, assume things about her intelligence. Now, every time my mother proved them wrong.‚Äù

Weekends and summers were spent with their father. They would take trips to Jamaica where they learned the history and culture through music and food. Her father recalls one of their trip to Jamaica in 1970: 

‚ÄúWe trudged through the cow dung and rusted iron gates, up-hill and down-hill, along narrow unkempt paths, to the very end of the family property, all in my eagerness to show to the girls the terrain over which I had wandered daily for hours as a boy‚Ä¶

Upon reaching the top of a little hill that opened much of that terrain to our full view, Kamala, ever the adventurous and assertive one, suddenly broke from the pack, leaving behind Maya the more cautious one, and took off like a gazelle in Serengeti, leaping over rocks and shrubs and fallen branches, in utter joy and unleashed curiosity to explore that same enticing terrain.‚Äú

But when the time came, for her own prenatal visits to the clinic she found that doctors and other mothers of a more enlightened age treated her as though she were perfectly normal. Phyllis admits, ‚ÄòRight after the baby was born, I‚Äôm afraid I did ask whether she was all right. Then they brought her to me and it was the most wonderful moment in my whole life.

Claw and tooth marks on the rear of the bison indicate that it was killed by a North American lion, an extinct Ice Age cat that was 25% larger than the modern lion. The lion managed to open the bison carcass and eat most of its muscle located in the ribs and upper limbs area. However, the bison carcass froze quickly, making it difficult for scavengers to fully consume.

In 1984, a group of paleontologists decided to cook and eat part of the neck muscle of the bison carcass. Professor emeritus of zoology at the University of Alaska, R Dale Guthrie, wrote about the event:

‚ÄúTo climax and celebrate [taxidermist] Eirik Granqvist‚Äôs work with Blue Babe, we had a bison stew dinner for him and for Bjorn Kurten ‚Ä¶ A small part of the mummy‚Äôs neck was diced and simmered in a pot of stock and vegetables. We had Blue Babe for dinner. The meat was well aged but still a little tough, and it gave the stew a strong Pleistocene aroma, but nobody there would have dared miss it.

The meat in its abdomen had spoiled before the bison was completely frozen. But in the neck area small pieces of meat were found attached to the skull. The lions had left so little there that it had frozen through while the meat was still fresh. When it thawed it gave off an unmistakable beef aroma, not unpleasantly mixed with a faint smell of the earth in which it was found, with a touch of mushroom. About a dozen of us gathered .... on April 6, 1984, to partake of Bison priscus stew. The taste was delicious, and none of us suffered any ill effects from the meal.‚Äù

The invention allowed a trapped individual in a burning high-rise to use the snorkel to breathe until rescue.

Below is more info from the patent application:

‚ÄúThe recent rash of fires in high-rise hotels has resulted in the death of numerous people due to toxic smoke inhalation. Although the various fire departments involved expedited recovery efforts to save such people from impending death, the various toxic gases intermixed with the smoke, resulting from the burning of plastic furniture materials and the like, proved lethal within a very short time period. It has thus proven critical to provide the entrapped hotel guest with a source of fresh air or oxygen until the guest is rescued. Furthermore, experience has shown that the entrapped guest should remain in his or her hotel room, rather than attempt to proceed to the roof or any other floor of the hotel, to facilitate the rescue operation.

A fireman, in performing firefighting and rescue operations of the above type, normally carries a canister of oxygen with him for breathing purposes. On occasion, the fireman will deplete his supply of oxygen to thus also subject himself to toxic smoke inhalation. Therefore, it would prove desirable to provide not only a hotel guest with a supply of fresh air, when needed, but to also provide such air to a fireman who may encounter the above type of emergency situation.‚Äù

I‚Äôve always wondered why Filipino is not spelled Philipino, since the country is spelled the Philippines.

So I did some digging and discovered that the ‚Äúph‚Äù sound doesn‚Äôt really exist in Tagalog (the national language of the Philippines). Most native Filipinos will pronounce it as ‚Äúpilipino‚Äù instead, which is typically shortened to ‚Äúpinoy.‚Äù The reason the country is called the Philippines is because the country was named after King Philip the II (1527-1598) of Spain.

Before the first European explorers arrived in the Philippines, there was no national identity, only clans and tribes spread out across the archipelago. This made it very easy for the Europeans to conquer the region since the division already existed amongst the people.

The Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to come in contact with the Philippines in March 1521. Magellan was driven by fervent religious zeal to convert the local tribes to Christianity and as a result, got embroiled in a local political dispute and was killed during battle. Although he is often credited as the first person to circumnavigate the world, Magellan himself never completed the journey.

After his death, his crew was captained by Juan Sebastian Elcano who continued the journey. They arrived in Spain in September of 1522, which was nearly a year and a half after Magellan‚Äôs death. Approximately 80% of the original crew members died during the voyage around the world.

Some historians believe that the first person to complete the trip around the world was a man by the name of Enrique of Malacca. At only 14-years-old, Enrique was enslaved by Magellan during the capture of Malacca by the Portuguese in 1511. He would go on to accompany Magellan back to Portugal, then to Spain, and then finally embark on the expedition to circumnavigate the world.

After Magellan‚Äôs death, Enrique bailed on the expedition when he was able to recognize the language that the local inhabitants were speaking, most likely because he had originally been born and raised in the Philippines before being brought to Malacca.

Not much else is known about her except the fact that she died in 1970 at age 75.

It would last two years, killing an estimated 50 million people.

Just as life seemed to get good during the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression hits the U.S. in 1929 when Koehler was 34 years old. And like the pandemic of 1918, it too began to spread, plunging the world‚Äôs GDP by 26.7%.¬† 

As economies around the world started to deteriorate during the 1930s, Nazi power began to rise. In 1939, a 44 year old Koehler watched as her country declared war on Germany for invading Poland. Over the next six years, 75 million people would die.

Wars continued throughout Koehler‚Äôs 50s and 60s. However, on July 20, 1969, a 74 year old Koehler would have witnessed something remarkable. Humans who were capable of such death and destruction, achieving what was thought to be impossible‚Äîlanding on the moon.",,1714319965

It is believed that the design was thought to confuse or trap witches, preventing them from easily climbing the stairs due to the staggered pattern.

Unlike traditional stairs with a regular series of steps, witches‚Äô stairs alternate, with each step offset to either the left or right. This design creates a zig-zag pattern, allowing for a steep incline without requiring a large horizontal space.

You will occasionally find them in very old New England homes.

17936269943734311,3347960412282643145_2461212201,"Lady Dai, also known as Xin Zhui, is one of the most famous mummies in the world, discovered in 1971 at the Mawangdui archaeological site in Changsha, China. She was the wife of Li Cang, the Marquis of Dai, during the Han Dynasty, and she died around 163 BCE. Her extraordinarily well-preserved mummy provides an invaluable glimpse into the health, lifestyle, and mortuary practices of the Han Dynasty.

What makes Lady Dai‚Äôs mummy so remarkable is the condition in which it was found. Despite being over 2,000 years old, her body was remarkably preserved: her skin was soft and moist, her limbs could be flexed, her hair was intact, and her internal organs were still in place. This exceptional preservation is attributed to the elaborate burial methods used, which included sealing her coffin in airtight layers of charcoal and clay, effectively preventing decay.

The tomb of Lady Dai also contained more than 1,000 artifacts and documents, offering insights into the culture and daily life of the time. These included exquisite silk garments, lacquerware, musical instruments, and foods that were buried with her, presumably to provide comfort in the afterlife.

Additionally, the texts found alongside her body, including some of the earliest versions of Daoist texts and medical manuscripts, have provided scholars with significant information on ancient Chinese philosophy, science, and medicine. The autopsy of her body revealed details about her health, showing that she suffered from various ailments such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes‚Äîconditions not uncommon today but only understood through the lens of modern science. 

Lady Dai‚Äôs tomb and mummy continue to be a crucial source for understanding ancient Chinese history and the advancements in burial practices that were aimed at preserving the dead with such incredible fidelity.

This has been a little tradition I started all the way back my first year teaching in 2008 (üò≥). For me, painting the windows is such an easy way to spread joy to others. While finishing up painting, a student approached me at the end of the day and said ‚ÄúMrs. Edington, I was watching you paint those houses from my classroom and it was the joy of my day‚Äù ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠ Oh my goodness are you kidding me?!? That right there is my why!

This year instead of doing a holiday character like I typically do, I opted for something a bit more simple, clean and wintery. If you have been following me for a while you know my sketchbook is FULL of cozy and quaint little homes so it seemed perfect to paint a little winter village. Plus, using just one color was clutch for time restraints. 

If you‚Äôre feeling festive and want to give window painting a try, just grab a brush some tempera paint! If you had a few pumps of hand soap to the paint you can use a razor blade to scrape it off- or just use the paint as is and wipe the windows down when you‚Äôre done! ‚ùÑÔ∏è For more of a ‚Äúmess free‚Äù option try chalk markers!

2. Paint the Windows as a Winter Village: This is such a fun activity you can do with students to spread holiday cheer to everyone! 

3. Make a giant banner for kids to color/ paint: This was a fun activity in my adapted art class! Drawn out in a bingo dauber and the kids colored in the village with @kwikstixpaint and tempera paint. 

4. Decorate brown bags as holiday gift bags: this has been a favorite for a few years! Just using white tempera paint or a paint pen, use my drawing guide as inspo to decorate a lunch bag and turn it into the most beautiful holiday gingerbread house 

5. Create a winter village project with printmaking: this picture was sent to my from @art_with_oconnor and I‚Äôm obsessed! She had her students draw their village on styrofoam printing plates to create a layered city look! 

6. Winter Village meets Van Gogh: an amazing and gorgeous spin on the project by @ms.tice_is_nice ! 

7. Great an interactive ‚Äúhome for the holidays‚Äù project! You can find a full free tutorial for this lesson on my blog! 

8. Make giant cardboard gingerbread houses: another fan favorite in adapted art class. Just using left over paper storage boxes, open as a trifold, start them off with a few home details and let their imaginations run away with @kwikstixpaint and white paint!

One of my favorite things to teach is figuring drawing but the concept of gesture drawing, proportions, light, loose lines, etc can be difficult for children under 10 to fully grasp. I remember being a kids and looking at drawing books that would have 10+ steps where the lines were intended to built upon and then erased at the end but i started the drawing in marker and couldn‚Äôt go backwards ü´† So I started just skipping to the last step of these guided drawings and just teaching myself to following the contour line.

Ask Them Questions! üôåüèº

 All you have to do is start by asking questions about the work they‚Äôre already drawing! This is a free way to make a big impact in encouraging your kiddos. 

So here are some questions you can ask your kiddo to help you connect and support their creativity (Save this post if you need to!) 

1. Can you tell me about what‚Äôs happening in your picture?
2. What made you choose those colors?
3. How did you decide to start your drawing this way?
4. What‚Äôs your favorite part of this drawing?
5. Were you thinking about anything special while you drew this?
6. What was the hardest part to draw, and how did you figure it out?
7. Is there a story behind this picture?
8. How does this drawing make you feel?
9. What would you add or change if you kept working on it?
10. What part of your picture are you most PROUD of and why? 

These simple yet important questions show your child that you value their work & creativity. It encourages their self-expression, and helps them to feel proud of their work‚Äî and will help you to see the world through your child‚Äôs lens. 

Their artwork is a glimpse into how your child sees the world, how they share their heart, tell a story, and express feelings. Their art is a powerful way of communication that we shouldn‚Äôt just glaze over but instead engage, and ask our child to tell us more. 

So take a moment to ask questions about their work, because chances are there is so much more in each line than what meets the eye ü©∑",,1730058814

But the GOOD NEWS is that I‚Äôm here to help you break the idea that you have to have the perfect working conditions/ studio/ infinite amount of uninterrupted time to make art. Because you don‚Äôt. Life is busy, and unfortunately things like painting for fun get pushed to the bottom of our priorities when push comes to shove. That‚Äôs why my husband and I created the @shop.quell  Carrier Case. To help you ditch the excuses and instead literally grab the solution to making more art! When you decide to swap out doom scrolling for drawing or painting in your sketchbook, something *magic* happens. You spend the same amount of time actually benefiting your mental health, calming your nervous system, gaining mental clarity & focus, and not to mention create something that has never existed in the world before! I mean cmon! How amazing is that?!? 

8 years ago I started my sketchbook practice and decided that if I wanted to make art everyday, things had to be portable so I could make art anytime I experienced wait time. Waiting at the doctors office? Sketchbook. Waiting in the car line to pick up my kid? Grab my sketchbook. Suddenly my practice took off and I started to look for any moment I could pull out my sketchbook to make art. Now with our Carrier Case, everything I need is in one place, all I have to do is open it and make the first mark üòä 

If you‚Äôre looking for a list of supplies I keep stocked in my Carrier Case, or more info about the Quell case just comment the word ‚ÄúLINK‚Äù And I‚Äôll send you a link to my most recent blog with alllll the supplies!! 

Thanks for being here, and I hope you spend this weekend carving out a little art time for yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è",,1726863319

The umbilical cord serves as a critical connection between a developing fetus and the placenta, delivering oxygen, nutrients, and essential waste removal.

The two smaller circles (arteries) carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta, while the larger circle (vein) brings oxygenated blood and nutrients back to the fetus. These vessels are surrounded by Wharton‚Äôs jelly, a protective, gelatinous tissue that cushions the vessels from compression.

This is the pre- and post-operative resection of gout tophus out of an elbow!!
Tophi are crystalline deposits made out of ureates or ureic acid in patients suffering from gout.
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint, where crystals in the form of monosodium urate form inside and around joints (called tophi).
The most known hallmark of the disease is hyperuricemia, but by itself it does not indicate gout. 
Hyperuricemia means an increased production of uric acid due either a defect or hyperactivity in different enzymes and increased cell turnover (or cell breakdown) in patients that use chemotherapy for cancer, have chronic hemolysis, or have hematologic malignancies. 
Another, even more common reason for gout is decreased excretion of uric acid by the kidneys due to renal disease or NSAID or diuretics usage. 
Inflammation typically develops when uric acid collect in the synovial fluid as the extracellular fluid becomes saturated with the acid which is then phagocytized by polymorphonuclear cells. This process develops inflammation. 
Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than 12 hours. The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.
Severe gout is characterised by frequent polyarticular flares, numerous tophi, joint damage, and musculoskeletal disability. This is a preventable condition and in many cases, represents a disease that has been insufficiently managed for years. Standard management recommendations may be insufficient for patients with severe gout; these patients frequently require intensive individualised pharmacological management with combinations of urate-lowering therapy and anti-inflammatory agents.",,1729886786

This image depicts a deeply moving moment of a preterm baby, born at just 24 weeks gestation and weighing 570 grams.
Babies born this early are considered micro-preemies, facing extraordinary challenges, as they are highly vulnerable to numerous complications due to underdeveloped organs and systems. The image, showing a tiny hand reaching out, reflects the fragility and resilience of life in its earliest and most vulnerable state.

At 24 weeks, the lungs, brain, and digestive system are not fully developed, requiring intense medical intervention in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This baby is likely receiving life-sustaining support, including mechanical ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for immature lungs, intravenous nutrition, and possibly phototherapy for jaundice. Every day is critical for a micro-preemie like this, with survival dependent on advanced neonatal care and the gradual maturation of vital organs.

This patient accidentally got too close to a table saw, resulting in a deep laceration through the pinky and thumb.
The injury extends through the tendons and veins, with the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon clearly severed. Notice the tendon bulging out of the wound, indicating a complete tear of the tendon.

The flexor digitorum superficialis tendon (FDS) is one of the key tendons responsible for flexion in the fingers. Each finger, except the thumb, has an FDS tendon that allows flexion at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, which is crucial for gripping and fine motor tasks. Without proper function of this tendon, the patient would have difficulty with any activity requiring finger flexion, such as grasping objects or making a fist.

In this case the pinky (5th digit) was severed from the table saw. The FDS tendon to the pinky is responsible for flexing the PIP joint. After the tendon is torn, the patient basically loses the ability to bend this joint, leading to reduced or incomplete flexion of the pinky.

In the case of the thumb, while the FDS tendon doesn‚Äôt exist in the thumb, the flexor pollicis longus tendon performs a similar function for thumb flexion. If the thumb‚Äôs tendons are severed, there would be difficulty flexing the thumb.

This patient went through tendon and vascular repair surgeries and the last photo shows the follow-up after one year of rehabilitation. He re-gained tendon integrity and most of its function back! ‚úãüèº",,1728498753

Ever wondered someone dying from heart problem and all at sudden doctors hit up with a strange experimental idea and replace the heart with a pump to save that person. This is where the left ventricular assist device, aka the pump, comes handy! 
Cardiac transplantation is an option for patients with severe heart failure, and a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, may help to bridge a patient while awaiting transplantation.
The LVAD is a battery-operated, mechanical pump, which helps the left ventricle pump blood to the rest of the body in patients who have reached end-stage heart failure. 
In other words, it‚Äôs a mechanical circulatory support that is used to salvage the cardiogenic shock patient and as a bridge to transplant therapy, but can also be permanent or be used for destination therapy.
By restoring the failing heart, it temporarily eliminates the need for a transplant.
Over the past several years, there has been a dramatic shift from the use of large pulsatile left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) to the use of smaller continuous-flow devices for the provision of mechanical circulatory support in patients with heart failure.",,1727989131

It‚Äôs got tiny little hands.
This was a tubal or ectopic pregnancy that resulted in a ruptured fallopian tube and severe bleeding.

Ectopic (‚Äòmisplaced‚Äô) pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube (tubal pregnancy). Less commonly, in locations such as the ovary, cervix, or abdominal cavity. The implantation of the pregnancy in a non-uterine location means that it cannot progress to term, and it poses a significant risk to the patient‚Äôs health.

As it grows, it can cause tubal distension, eventually leading the tubal bursts/rupture, which results in severe intra-abdominal bleeding and can cause life-threatening hemorrhagic shock.

Clinically, ruptured ectopic pregnancy presents with acute lower abdominal pain, signs of peritoneal irritation, hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia), vaginal bleeding and possibly referred shoulder pain from diaphragmatic irritation. Diagnosis is confirmed via transvaginal ultrasound (empty uterus, adnexal mass) and elevated Œ≤-hCG levels that do not rise appropriately.

Treatment for rupture is typically emergency surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) to control bleeding and remove the ectopic tissue and either a part of the whole fallopian tube along with the pregnancy will be surgically removed.

The finger was reduced on the field by his coach and he continued playing.
(The second photo is not the actual patient, but to better visualize the position of the dislocated phalanx).
Finger dislocation is a common injury. It occurs when the bones of the finger are moved (dislocated) from their normal position. Foremost among these injuries is the dorsal dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal  joint caused by a hyperextension injury.
But in simpler words, it can occur in any of the joints of any finger, but it occurs most often in the middle knuckle of the little, ring, middle, or index finger.
 
Treatment includes reduction which is the medical term for repositioning the bone into its proper place.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines use powerful magnets to generate detailed images of the body‚Äôs internal structures. The strength of the magnet in an MRI machine is measured in teslas (T).
Most clinical MRI machines have magnet strengths of 1.5T or 3T, with 3T being more common in modern facilities due to its higher image resolution and faster scan times.

The magnets in MRI machines are thousands of times stronger than household magnets.

Here‚Äôs an incredible birth story of a baby born still enclosed within the amniotic sac. ‚ù§

‚ÄúThe human body is truly an amazing thing. 8.5.2017 at about 10am I started having contractions. I was only 29 weeks and 4 days so I just figured they were Braxton hicks and decided to wait it out. After about 45 minutes of consistent contractions that were increasing in intensity I decided I should probably go in. I there in some clothes. Grabbed my daughter some clothes, her my fiance And I left for the hospital. I dropped my daughter to her God mommy Nicole ¬†And headed to the hospital. Well the contractions continued to get closer together and more intense and before I knew it I knew it was time to push. I called 911 because I was so scared. They couldn‚Äôt understand me between the screams with contractions. So I handed the phone to my fiance.¬†
I pulled my pants off and reached down, sure enough his head was right there. I pushed one time and my miracle baby was here. When I looked down I realized he was still completely wrapped in the amniotic sac. The dispatcher told us to pull over. But I knew we would make it to the hospital before they would make it to us. So I told Ean to keep driving. I was so scared. My Fiance was so calm driving and on the phone with 911. At first the baby was still and all I could do was pray he would be okay. And then I rubbed his face with my thumb and he pulled his little hands and feet up to his face as if he understood my prayers and wanted to reassure us he was okay. About 7 minutes passed that I held this miracle baby in my hands until we made it to the hospital. A familiar face came running out and grabbed my baby. He was born an caul. This happens 1 in every 80,000 births. Usually during c-section.¬† He was 3lb 1oz. He doing wonderful all things considered all He went through I know he‚Äôs going to be an awesome little man! ‚ù§ he is truly a miracle baby. We are so blessed to be his parents.‚Äù

This is a case of a 79 year old man who presented to the hospital with a large fungating right facial mass. He reports first noticing a small growth at the right eyebrow over a year ago. Over time, he had become increasingly self conscious of the mass and was isolating himself at home, refusing to go out or seek medical attention. On MRI, the mass extended deep into the right orbit with marked destruction of the right globe, the medial orbital wall, ethmoid, frontal and maxillary sinuses. Biopsy demonstrated invasive squamous cell carcinoma. 
‚Å†
The patient underwent extensive surgery including wide resection of right facial squamous cell carcinoma, right partial maxillectomy with orbital exenteration, right partial rhinectomy and modified right neck dissection. He required temporary tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube immediately after surgery. Although very locally invasive, he did not have nodal or distant metastases. For his stage IV T4N0M0 disease, he completed a course of radiation. Although he tolerated multiple surgery and radiation treatments, he continued to have ongoing depression. He lacks social support and continues to have difficulty coping with his chronic illness. .‚Å†

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are common lesions usually cured with local therapy in over 90 percent of cases. Compared to basal cell carcinomas, cutaneous SCCs have a higher potential for local recurrence and regional or distant metastases. In determining how to manage cutaneous SCC, the risk of local regional recurrence and regional or distant metastasis is the most important factor.‚Å†

On 17th of July 2021 climber Fahad Badar (who later became the 1st Arab man to double summit Everest & Lhotse in one trip) started the fateful summit push on Broadpeak and by summit the next day several accidents happened leaving him hypothermic and his hands severely frostbitten.

Never in a million years did he ever think he would lose his fingers to frostbite, especially doing what love most - climbing mountains.
His life, his body will never be the same again after this life changing surgery.
He was told by surgeons he will never climb again. He challenged them and climbed K2 summit just 10 months after surgery. He says ‚Äúnever say never, everything is possible if you put your mind on it‚Äù.

Frostbite is a type of gangrene caused by freezing of the skin and underlying tissues.
The nature of frostbite has been highly controversial. Until recently, it was believed that it was a direct thermal injury to the tissue. Others believed the indirect injury resulted from changes in the microcirculation. It appears both mechanisms are important. 
Cold can destroy tissue directly by forming intracellular ice crystals or more commonly by interstitial freezing with consequent extraction of water from the cells. But the blood supply to the frozen area also undergoes profound changes. 
Frostbite causes tortuous dilatation of the small vessels, as well as occlusions and intravascular tubular filling defects. Vascular stasis follows, causing ischemia and subsequent tissue necrosis and gangrene ‚Äî death of tissue resulting from gradual loss of blood supply. The tissue slowly dies because it receives little or no oxygen and nutrients from the blood, but it does not become infected (i.e. In cases of wet gangrene).
The first symptoms experienced are numbness and tingling sensation in the affected area. 
The severity of tissue damage depends upon the degree and the duration of cold. Thus, wind, wetness, contact with metal, or anything that speeds heat loss increases the danger to exposed parts of the body.
The frostbitten limb undergoes acute changes within hours and in situations like this, amputation is done to prevent progression.

A man who suffered devastating 3rd- and 4th-degree burns to over 40% of his body after surviving the deadly Station nightclub fire has shared his joy at the birth of his baby daughter!!

This is Joe. On February 20th, 2003 while enjoying a rock concert with a girlfriend, a special effects malfunction caused a fire to break out after using pyrotechnics in their set.
A hundred people died and more than 200 were injured as concert-goers desperately tried to escape. Some, like Joe and his former girlfriend, suffocated among the crowd.

The nightclub was way over capacity. Realizing quickly what was going on I made my way from near the front row to the nearest exit. In an effort to protect Karla, I placed my leather vest over her.
As we made it towards the exit people fell in front of me and then on top of me. Karla suffocated and did not survive, but she was not burned.
I was trapped and conscious throughout the entire ordeal. I could hear everything going on around me. The sounds of yelling were quite loud. Then it grew quieter and quieter. Then it was just me.
Next, I heard the voice of a firefighter, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got one over here.‚Äù

After suffering burns to 40 per cent of his body and nearly losing his scalp, he spent a year in hospital undergoing skin grafts. He lost his fingers, toes and his left eye.

Psoriasis is a complex immune-mediated disorder that presents as inflammatory plaques in the skin.
This multifactorial, inflammatory disease that involves hyperproliferation of the keratinocytes in the epidermis, with an increase in the epidermal cell turnover rate.
These skin patches are typically red, dry, itchy, and scaly. On people with darker skin the patches may be purple in color.
Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage.
The disease most commonly manifests on the skin of the elbows, knees, scalp, lumbosacral areas, intergluteal clefts, and glans penis.
The most common skin manifestations are scaling, salmon-colored/erythematous macules, papules, and plaques. Typically, the macules are seen first, and these progress to maculopapules and ultimately well-demarcated, noncoherent, silvery plaques overlying a glossy homogeneous erythema. The area of skin involvement varies with the form of psoriasis.
Chronic stationary psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) is the most common type of psoriasis. This involves the scalp, extensor surfaces, genitals, umbilicus, and lumbosacral and retroauricular regions.
Plaque psoriasis is characterized by raised, inflamed lesions covered with a silvery white scale. The scale may be scraped away to reveal inflamed skin beneath. This is most common on the extensor surfaces of the knees, elbows, scalp, and trunk.
Guttate psoriasis presents as small salmon-pink papules, 1-10 mm in diameter, predominately on the trunk; the lesions may be scaly. It frequently appears suddenly, 2-3 weeks after an upper respiratory infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.
Pustular psoriasis presents as sterile pustules appearing on the palms and soles or diffusely over the body. It may cycle through erythema, pustules, then scaling.
Erythrodermic psoriasis presents as generalized erythema, pain, itching, and fine scaling; various pustular forms also exist. It typically encompasses nearly the entire body surface area. It may be accompanied by fever, chills, hypothermia, and dehydration secondary to the large body surface area involvement.",,1718313291

The human body is truly amazing.
This photo shows you a rare glimpse at something that‚Äôs called fascia, it‚Äôs the white covering that is on top of muscle and under the skin!

Fascia is a layer of connective tissue below the skin.‚Äå It surrounds and holds every organ, blood vessel, bone, nerve fiber and muscle in place. The tissue does more than provide internal structure; fascia has nerves that make it almost as sensitive as skin.

Fascia can be broken down into four main layers: superficial, deep, visceral, and parietal.

Superficial fascia is right under the skin. It‚Äôs thicker in the main part of the body (stomach, chest, etc.), and it gets thinner in places further away, like in the hands and feet.
Deep fascia covers bones, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels.
The visceral fascia layer goes around certain organs that settle into the body‚Äôs open spaces, including the lungs, heart, and stomach. 

The injury in this case was caused by a screw bolt that was sticking out of a stove! The patient was injured when he pushed a stove off of a dolly that was about to fall on a coworker. He saved the coworker from harm, but unfortunately was cut on the arm in the process by a bolt sticking out of the stove. Resulting in the injury shown in the photos.

An ‚Äòen caul‚Äô birth is when the baby comes out still inside an intact amniotic sac (caul). This rare thing of beauty happens in less than 1 in 80,000 births.
Those that are born inside their amniotic sac are said to be lucky, special or protected.

We‚Äôve previously featured babies being born within their amniotic sac, or en caul, and these rare births never cease to amaze us. 
The amniotic sac, or bag of water, or membranes, is a balloon-like membrane filled with amniotic fluid that a fetus grows in during pregnancy.
In most cases, rupture of the amniotic sac occurs spontaneously at full term either during or at the beginning of labor. 
If that event doesn‚Äôt take place, amniotomy (an artificial rupture of membranes) is the procedure done by which the amniotic sac is deliberately ruptured so as to cause the release of amniotic fluid. Amniotomy is usually performed for the purpose of inducing or expediting labor. 
An en-caul birth, when a baby emerges still encased in the amniotic sac at birth, is extremely rare but it does not pose a specific risk on the baby nor the mother.
It is a beautiful sight.

üî∏I ricercatori dell‚ÄôUniversit√† di Padova e dell‚ÄôIstituto Veneto di Medicina Molecolare hanno scoperto un meccanismo potenzialmente utile a combattere l‚Äôobesit√†.

üî∏Questo meccanismo coinvolge il grasso bruno, un particolare tipo di grasso deputato alla dissoluzione del grasso per generare calore, quindi adatto a ‚Äúbruciare grasso‚Äù. Purtroppo, la sua quantit√† diminuisce con l‚Äôet√†. Per tale motivo, i ricercatori tentano di ‚Äúistruire‚Äù il grasso bianco a fare la medesima cosa (diventando cosi grasso ‚Äúbeige‚Äù).

I ricercatori hanno scoperto che nel grasso di individui normopeso si registrano alti livelli di una proteina chiamata Opa1. Essa √® una proteina mitocondriale che risulta essenziale per controllare il metabolismo e per regolare l‚Äôapoptosi. Non solo, ma in modelli sperimentali si √® visto che Opa1 riesce a convertire il grasso bianco in grasso ‚Äúbeige‚Äù, anche se il meccanismo non √® noto. Tuttavia, altri studi hanno scoperto che sono coinvolti anche ciclo dell‚Äôurea e fumarato, quest‚Äôultimo √® il responsabile della conversione in tessuto ‚Äúbeige‚Äù. Pertanto, la somministrazione di fumarato ha convertito il grasso ‚Äúmagazzino di grassi‚Äù a grasso ‚Äúbrucia grassi‚Äù.

üîπIn uno studio pubblicato su JAMA Neurology, i ricercatori hanno raccolto i risultati delle biopsie intestinali di pazienti celiaci. Sono stati raccolti i dati di oltre ventottomila pazienti, le cui condizioni neurologiche sono state messe a confronto con quelle di 139mila individui inseriti nel gruppo di controllo. Lo scopo dello studio era quello di esaminare il rischio di sviluppare neuropatia nei pazienti affetti da celiachia diagnosticata mediante biopsia.

üîπRISULTATI
La celiachia era associata a un rischio 2,5 volte maggiore di neuropatia successiva (IC 95%, p<0,001). Non solo, ma gli studiosi hanno riscontrato un aumento del rischio anche di neuropatia demielinizzante infiammatoria cronica (p=0,001), neuropatia autonomica (p=0,009) e mononeurite multipla (p=0,006). Ciononostante, non c‚Äô√® stata nessuna associazione con la polineuropatia demielinizzante infiammatoria acuta.
Si pu√≤ quindi affermare che i pazienti con celiachia presentano un rischio maggiore di sviluppare neuropatia.
Alla base della celiachia e di alcuni disturbi del sistema nervoso potrebbe esserci un‚Äôorigine autoimmune comune.

Alcuni ricercatori dell‚ÄôUniversit√† di Padova, in collaborazione con le Universit√† di Torino e la Statale di Milano, hanno scoperto che la differenziazione delle cellule staminali, anche nelle prime fasi della gravidanza, √® fortemente condizionata dalla disponibilit√† dell‚Äôamminoacido glutammina.
Queste cellule staminali, insieme all‚Äôepiblasto nativo, danno origine a tutte le cellule adulte, ma tale caratteristica √® associata all‚Äôipometilazione del genoma.

üß´La glutammina, infatti, pu√≤ essere eliminata dalla ‚Äúdieta‚Äù di queste cellule, oppure esse possono essere rese incapaci di metabolizzarla, con opportuni trattamenti di laboratorio. Il risultato √® l‚Äôincapacit√† delle cellule staminali di differenziarsi correttamente.

‚ñ™Ô∏èIn uno studio pubblicato su JAMA Psychiatry, gli autori hanno dimostrato come la somministrazione di psilocibina, tossina fungina, in combinazione con la psicoterapia, ha ridotto fortemente il consumo di alcol rispetto al gruppo placebo.

Fonte¬†PMID:¬†36001306

‚ñ™Ô∏èMa cosa √® la psilocibina? √à una tossina fungina rinvenuta nei carpofori di Psilocybe mexicana R. Heim (in foto), fungo impiegato in pratiche divinatorie da alcune popolazioni indigene del Messico. Si pu√≤ trovare anche in altri generi fungini come Panaeolus, Inocybe e Stropharia. Chimicamente √® un derivato indolico e rappresenta una neurotossina (triptamina psichedelica) il cui bersaglio √®, appunto, il sistema nervoso.

‚ñ™Ô∏èMeccanismo d‚Äôazione: la psilocibina √® un analogo di dopamina e serotonina, pertanto ne mima l‚Äôazione. Nel sistema nervoso centrale, inoltre, si comporta come agonista della serotonina (agendo sui recettori) e ne ostacola la degradazione a livello sinaptico. Ne consegue un effetto simpaticomimetico per accumulo della serotonina nella sinapsi e per iperstimolazione dei recettori.

‚ñ™Ô∏èEffetti: deviazioni delle normali funzioni psichiche, disturbi dell‚Äôequilibrio, euforia e disforia, perdita della nozione di tempo e spazio, alterazioni vista e udito, allucinazioni. L‚Äôingestione della tossina, quindi, causa la sindrome allucinogena (detta anche psicodisleptica). Sono sufficienti 4-8 mg di psilocibina presente in 20 gr di fungo fresco

üî∏L‚Äôinvecchiamento √® un fenomeno naturale che per√≤ si accompagna ad un progressivo declino di varie funzioni dell‚Äôorganismo.

üî∏Durante l‚Äôinvecchiamento, a livello molecolare, si assiste ad una progressiva diminuzione delle propriet√† meccaniche di particolari cellule, i FIBROBLASTI. Essi, quando sono giovani, riescono ad attivare un interruttore genico anti-invecchiamento, appunto, chiamato YAP/TAZ responsabile, ad esempio, del mantenimento dell‚Äôintegrit√† nucleare. Con l‚Äôinvecchiamento, per√≤, i fibroblasti non funzionano come dovrebbero e causano una perdita di integrit√† la quale, a suo volta, genera una condizione di stress per le cellule.

Il 23 luglio 2022 l'OMS ha dichiarato il vaiolo delle scimmie ""'Emergenza di salute pubblica internazionale"" 
Vediamo alcune informazioni:

üî∏TRASMISSIONE:
Il virus non si trasmette facilmente da persona a persona. La trasmissione umana avviene principalmente tramite il contatto con materiale infetto proveniente dalle lesioni cutanee o con oggetti contaminati (lenzuola, vestiti‚Ä¶), oppure il contatto prolungato faccia a faccia (attraverso droplets respiratori) e durante i rapporti intimi.

üî∏SINTOMI:
Nell‚Äôuomo si presenta con febbre, dolori muscolari, cefalea, rigonfiamento dei linfonodi  stanchezza e, successivamente, con manifestazioni cutanee quali vescicole, pustole, piccole croste. La malattia generalmente si risolve spontaneamente in 2-4 settimane con adeguato riposo e senza terapie specifiche, ma si possono usare antivirali se necessario. Tuttavia, il vaiolo delle scimmie pu√≤ causare una malattia pi√π grave soprattutto in alcuni gruppi di popolazione particolarmente fragili quali  bambini, donne in gravidanza e persone immunosoppresse. Il periodo di incubazione pu√≤ variare da 5 a 21 giorni (in genere circa 12 giorni).
Le complicanze del vaiolo delle scimmie possono includere infezioni batteriche secondarie, broncopolmonite, sepsi, encefalite e infezione della cornea con conseguente perdita della vista.

üî∏TRATTAMENTO:
√à possibile che le persone che sono state vaccinate contro il vaiolo (vaccinazione abolita in Italia nel 1981) siano a minor rischio di infezione con il monkeypox per la similitudine del virus del vaiolo con il monkeypox. Nell‚Äôattuale contesto epidemiologico non √® raccomandata la vaccinazione per la popolazione generale, anche se √® partita in 4 regioni italiane: Lombardia, Lazio, Emilia-Romagna e Veneto. 
Il trattamento del vaiolo delle scimmie √® sintomatico e di supporto, compresa la prevenzione e il trattamento delle infezioni batteriche secondarie. Un antivirale noto come Tecovirimat che √® stato sviluppato per il vaiolo, √® stato autorizzato dall‚ÄôEMA per il trattamento del vaiolo delle scimmie nel 2022 ma non √® ancora ampiamente disponibile.

I sistemi che maggiormente sono colpiti sono il Sistema nervoso centrale e periferico e il sistema muscolare. 

Un team di ricercatori dell'Universit√† di Padova ha pubblicato su ""Brain"" uno studio in cui viene evidenziato come l'utilizzo di vettori virali adeno-associati in modelli murini √® utilizzato per contrastare le mutazioni cellulari alla base di alcune patologie.

Inoltre, i topi trattati hanno manifestato un minor deficit neurologico e motorio, ma anche minori deficit biochimici.

üìùOpinione molto diffusa era quella secondo la quale le cellule tumorali circolanti (CTC) si formassero costantemente o nascessero come reazione a stimoli meccanici (interventi chirurgici), ma questo in realt√† non √® sempre vero.¬†Il gruppo di ricerca ha prelevato un campione di sangue da 30 pazienti con cancro al seno due volte: alle 4 del mattino (fase di sonno) e alle 10 del mattino (fase di veglia). Ha cos√¨ scoperto che quasi l'80 per cento delle CTC totali proveniva dal campione di sangue notturno.

üìùQuale potrebbe essere la spiegazione?¬†Durante la fase di sonno, i geni responsabili della proliferazione cellulare risultavano sovra-regolati (cio√® sono pi√π attivi del solito). Lo studio dimostra in modo impressionante come la biologia delle cellule tumorali vari nell'arco delle 24 ore. Questa dipendenza circadiana potrebbe cambiare radicalmente il modo in cui i medici diagnosticano e trattano il cancro

La dormienza √®  un fenomeno molto importante, soprattutto per quanto riguarda la sua rilevanza clinica. Quello che sappiamo √® che ci sono una serie di tumori (ad esempio il tumore della mammella o della prostata) in cui ci sono periodi di rimessione lunghissimi, ma poi c'√® una recidiva anche dopo 10/20 anni. Quello che inizialmente si pensava √® che clinicamente si fosse sviluppato un nuovo tumore, in realt√† non √® cos√¨. Infatti, si √® evidenziato in seguito a biopsia ed analisi istologiche che questa ricaduta non dipendeva dalla formazione di una nuova massa tumorale, bens√¨ da metastasi che si sono sviluppate (nel precedente tumore) e che sono rimaste dormienti. Quello che accade in questo tipo di tumori, come quella alla mammella e alla prostata, √® che ci sono cellule che disseminano precocemente e vengono accolte da nicchie che hanno tutte le componenti per supportare lo stato di dormienza e  la proliferazione cellulare. 
Per cui queste cellule metastatiche, rimangono dormienti fino a quando segnali stressori non vanno ad attivarle.
Questo ha permesso di definire il concetto di malattia minima residua e il concetto di dipendenza da oncogeni.

Brevettato nel 1899 con il nome commerciale aspirina, questo medicinale fa parte dei cosiddetti farmaci antinfiammatori non steroidei (FANS) e viene utilizzato soprattutto per trattare sintomi come febbre, mal di testa, mal di denti, dolori mestruali, reumatici e muscolari.

Tra i vari tumori,  quello colorettale √® la neoplasia per la quale, al momento, l‚Äôaspirina sembra pi√π efficace in termini di prevenzione, tanto che nel 2016 la U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) statunitense ha pubblicato un documento nel quale suggeriva ufficialmente il suo utilizzo PER ALCUNE CATEGORIE DI PERSONE (Nota bene), per ridurre il rischio di malattie cardiovascolari e tumore colorettale.
Secondo il documento, per√≤, la terapia preventiva ha dei limiti e l‚Äôassunzione di aspirina a basse dosi √® consigliata in particolare agli adulti di et√† compresa tra 50 e 59 anni. Il farmaco infatti ha un‚Äôazione antiaggregante, ovvero impedisce alle piastrine di formare coaguli e rende pi√π fluido il sangue. Per questo, quando lo si usa quotidianamente, bisogna fare attenzione a eventuali sanguinamenti anche non visibili, per esempio quelli rilevabili con esame delle feci.
I risultati di prevenzione sono invece meno convincenti quando si tratta di persone tra i 60 e i 69 anni e non sono sufficienti a raccomandare l‚Äôuso del medicinale a chi ha meno di 50 o pi√π di 70 anni.
Sebbene i risultati nella prevenzione del tumore del colon-retto e in altre neoplasie sembrano promettenti, si potrebbe pensare di assumere un po‚Äô di aspirina ogni giorno per tenere alla larga il cancro. In realt√†, al momento sarebbe una scelta azzardata, se non per le categorie citate sopra per le quali la terapia √® gi√† raccomandata.

üîªL‚Äôassunzione di vitamina D avviene prevalentemente da fonti animali (olio di fegato di merluzzo, salmone, aringa, spigola, uova), mentre tra gli alimenti vegetali troviamo in particolare alcuni funghi. Ciononostante, la principale via di sintesi ha luogo grazie all‚Äôesposizione ai raggi UV, in grado di attivare il 7-deidrocolesterolo (pelle) a pre-D3, la quale poi subir√† due idrossilazioni.

Da uno studio condotto dall‚ÄôIstituto di scienze delle produzioni alimentari del Cnr, in collaborazione con il John Innes Centre di Norwich e pubblicato sulla rivista¬†Nature Plants, viene progettata una nuova linea di pomodoro in grado di contrastare la carenza di vitamina D.

üîªIn cosa consiste?
Viene sfruttata una tecnica di editing del genoma, in particolare la CRISPR/Cas9, la quale ha consentito di introdurre, in modo molto specifico, una modifica nella sequenza del gene che codifica per la 7-deidrocolesterolo reduttasi 2. In questo modo, i frutti presentavano livelli notevoli di pro-vitaminaD3 e, se venivano trattati con luce UV, tale pro-vitaminaD3 veniva convertita in vitamina D.

La terapia genica mira a correggere nelle cellule ‚Äòmalate‚Äô la funzione di un gene difettoso, con il trasferimento di una versione corretta e funzionale dello stesso gene. Un tipico protocollo di terapia genica prevede 3 fasi: 
-la raccolta delle cellule staminali del sangue dal paziente che viene sottoposto a un regime farmacologico che spinge una parte delle cellule staminali ad abbandonare la nicchia nella quale risiedono all‚Äôinterno del midollo osseo per raggiungere la circolazione sanguigna. Questo trattamento √® anche noto come ‚Äòmobilizzazione‚Äô ed √® in genere molto ben tollerato; 
-la loro correzione genetica in laboratorio per cui, una volta raggiunto il sangue, le cellule staminali possono essere prelevate, purificate e trasferite in laboratorio, dove vengono corrette geneticamente; 
-la loro re-infusione (o trapianto) nel paziente, ma prima che questo avvenga √® necessario ‚Äòfare loro spazio‚Äô nel midollo osseo del paziente, dove possano attecchire e ripopolare con la loro progenie corretta tutte le linee cellulari sanguigne. 
L‚Äôidea di base della scoperta √®  di mettere in competizione tra loro le cellule corrette con quelle residenti e ancora portatrici della mutazione, rendendo pi√π difficile a queste ultime di ripopolare la nicchia staminale all‚Äôinterno del midollo. Il primo passo √® stato sfruttare il trattamento di mobilizzazione: per poter funzionare, questo trattamento danneggia le proteine di superficie che le cellule staminali del sangue usano per ancorarsi all‚Äôinterno del midollo, ma i ricercatori hanno osservato che queste ‚Äòproteine-ancora‚Äô vengono efficacemente ricostituite nelle cellule corrette durante la fase di coltura in laboratorio. Se reinfuse al picco di un trattamento di mobilizzazione, le cellule corrette hanno quindi un vantaggio nell‚Äôoccupare la nicchia rispetto a quelle appena esposte al trattamento. Per potenziare ulteriormente il loro vantaggio, i ricercatori hanno pensato di utilizzare la tecnologia a mRNA che favorisce un'espressione superiore rispetto a quella fisiologica delle proteine-ancora",,1654773429

Un nuovo¬†studio¬†ha individuato un¬†virus sperimentale¬†che uccide il cancro ed √® stato somministrato per la prima volta a un paziente umano, con la speranza di riuscire ad avere un nuovo mezzo per combattere con successo i tumori.

Il virus in questione √®, chiamato¬†CF33-hNIS (aka Vaxinia). Parliamo di un virus oncolitico, cio√® un virus geneticamente modificato progettato per infettare e uccidere selettivamente le cellule tumorali risparmiando quelle sane.

CF33-hNIS nello specifico √® un¬†virus del vaiolo¬†modificato¬†che agisce entrando nelle cellule e duplicandosi. Alla fine la cellula esplode, rilasciando particelle virali che agiscono come antigeni. Questo permette la stimolazione quindi del sistema immunitario che va ad attaccare le cellule tumorali vicine.

Per proseguire con i test devono essere arruolati circa 100 pazienti con tumore in fase avanzata o in fase metastatica.Una¬†volta arruolati, questi pazienti riceveranno basse dosi del trattamento sperimentale tramite iniezione diretta o per via endovenosa.

Se i primi risultati hanno successo e CF33-hNIS √® ritenuto sicuro e ben tollerato, ulteriori test indagheranno come il farmaco si accoppia con pembrolizumab, un trattamento anticorpale esistente gi√† utilizzato nell‚Äôimmunoterapia contro il cancro.

La sua produzione risulta necessaria per incrementare la nostra energia. 

Con la sua azione, questo ormone tende ad inibire le funzioni corporee non indispensabili nel breve periodo, garantendo il massimo sostegno agli organi vitali. 

Per questo motivo il cortisolo:

‚óè aumenta la gittata cardiaca

‚óè aumenta la glicemia, incrementando la gluconeogenesi epatica andando a stimolare la secrezione di glucagone e riducendo l'attivit√† dei recettori insulinici 

‚óè diminuisce la sintesi di collagene e della matrice ossea, accelerando l'osteoporosi

‚óè abbassa le difese immunitarie diminuendo anche le reazioni infiammatorie 

‚óè favorisce il catabolismo proteico

√à importante dire che un aumento di cortisolo si manifesta anche in casi di digiuno prolungato o di abitudini alimentari non corrette. Infatti saltare la prima colazione e/o mangiare abbondantemente in un unico pasto favorisce un aumento della produzione di cortisolo. 

Per cui √® importante mantenere questo ormone sotto controllo in quanto condizioni di ipercortisolismo possono portare a spiacevoli conseguenze, come ad esempio:

‚óè Ipertensione

‚óè alterazioni del ciclo mestruale 

‚óè debolezza muscolare

‚óè cefalea 

‚óè depressione

Per Ubiquitinazione si intende una modificazione post-traduzionale che, spesso, viene effettuata per portare alla degradazione di una proteina. √à un processo fisiologico che prevede il legame di uno o pi√π monomeri di ubiquitina (raffigurata nella prima diapositiva) alla proteina da degradare.

L‚Äôubiquitina viene legata alla proteina bersaglio in modo covalente grazie all‚Äôazione di alcuni enzimi specifici (E1, E2, E3). Vediamo i vari passaggi:

1) Attivazione dell‚Äôubiquitina grazie all‚ÄôATP, che si lega come AMP;

2) Successivamente si ha la formazione di un legame tioestere ad alta energia tra un carbonile di una glicina e un residuo di cisteina dell‚Äôenzima E1;

3) In seguito, l‚Äôubiquitina viene trasferita su un‚Äôaltra cisteina presente nel sito attivo dell‚Äôenzima E2;

4) L‚Äôultimo passaggio prevede l‚Äôintervento dell‚Äôenzima E3 che, insieme ad E2, integra il substrato da degradare (target).

Il risultato √® il legame tra ubiquitina e target da degradare.

1Ô∏è‚É£ LAMINATOR üìÉ
Most schools have laminators for teachers to use, but the lamination is thin, peels easily, and the machines have a tendency to break often. A personal laminator provides thicker lamination that can be cut without peeling (and it‚Äôs a great way to make friends with other teachers in the building)!
‚ú®TIP:‚ú® Having 2 laminators (one for school & one for home) is a GAME CHANGER!

2Ô∏è‚É£ PAPER CUTTER ‚úÇÔ∏è
Similar to laminators, most schools have paper cutters available but they tend to have extremely dull blades that bend the paper instead of cutting it. A personal paper cutter saves your hands (scissor blisters, anyone?!) and is much faster!
‚ú®TIP:‚ú® There are half-size paper cutters that can easily be stored in a drawer!

I‚Äôve been pretty MIA here on Instagram so it‚Äôs time to fill you in. There have been a lot of ups & plenty of downs. Some I‚Äôll share & some I won‚Äôt. We all know that social media never tells the full story & there‚Äôs always more happening behind the scenes that doesn‚Äôt get shown but here are a few updates:

üö® MOST RELEVANT - Change is coming (which is scary but also exciting) üò¨ I‚Äôll do a more formal post soon with the details, but for now‚Ä¶ just know that this is a crazy time for me & I‚Äôm going to do my best to share the journey with you.

 ü•∞ PERSONAL - I've been trying to figure out what makes me happiest, how I can best serve others, the impact I can make, ways I can set and reach goals that are important to me, & how I can provide value to the world. I‚Äôve had moments of, ‚ÄúWhat am I even doing with my life?‚Äù (AKA a mid-life crisis at the age of 30) but also, ‚ÄúMichelle, you can do hard things & make a difference‚Äù so I‚Äôm trying to balance being courageous, realistic, & genuine without sacrificing too much of what makes me, me üñ§

üåç TRAVEL - Germany was beautiful üá©üá™ I love seeing how uniquely different cultures are, yet we are all so similar at our core as human beings. Our family saw some amazing sights, ate delicious food, created lasting memories, & I‚Äôm grateful for opportunities to experience the world outside of my usual sphere üó∫Ô∏è

üìö BOOKS - I‚Äôve read 27 books so far this year, so I‚Äôm over halfway to my goal of reading 52 books in a year üéâ 

ü•ó FOOD - Y‚Äôall know I love food üòçüòã Lately, I‚Äôve loved trying new recipes & experimenting with flavors. It‚Äôs been a mix of foods that are good for my body & good for my soul, & they both make me happy.

üí™üèº FITNESS - Oh yeah, I still lift heavy things & put them down üòÇ I competed in a powerlifting meet at the end of April‚Ä¶ I qualified for Nationals again in a new weight class (52kg), got 1st place for females, & got drug tested for the first time (which is exciting because it feels like an accomplishment that I‚Äôm strong enough to get tested üòÖ).

My January goal was to read 5 books and I‚Äôm happy to share that I exceeded the goal but finishing 6 books üéâ

As someone who has never been a big reader, here were some of the things that helped me build this new habit:
‚ñ™Ô∏è Choosing the books before the month started
‚ñ™Ô∏è Variety of book types
‚ñ™Ô∏è Keeping the books visible
‚ñ™Ô∏è Using small pockets of time to read
‚ñ™Ô∏è Documenting each completed book in an app (TBR Bookshelf)

Intentional with my training üí™üèº
Intentional with my planning ‚úèÔ∏è

Intention, by definition, means having an aim. A plan.

I've always been a planner (I'm sure that's no surprise) but I'm also a huge creature of habit (aka I fall into a routine and it's hard for me to break out of it).

If I'm not careful, weeks will go by where I'm stuck in a routine like a hamster on a wheel without making any real progress. Can anyone else relate or is this a me problem?! üòÖüêπ

One of the first changes I made this year was to set aside time each day to INTENTIONALLY plan my days, weeks, and months ahead... aka make sure that wheel is actually moving forward instead of just rotating in place üõûüòÇ

My digital planner has been the perfect accountability buddy and has helped me be as productive as possible in the few minutes I dedicate to my personal planning each day ü•∞

‚ÅâÔ∏è FAQ ‚ÅâÔ∏è

‚ùì Where can I get a timer video?
üí¨ Canva only has shorter timer videos in their element library (30-60 seconds) so I suggest inserting in your own video file. I have a set of timer videos that includes 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minute timers in my TPT store if you need some (link above).

‚ùì Can I use a YouTube video as a timer?
üí¨ Yes, but it won‚Äôt play automatically. If you want to use a YouTube video, I suggest searching for an ‚Äúinterval timer‚Äù that will replay the same time frame over and over so you only have to hit play once. But, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to use a transition/clean up slide.

‚ùì Can I create these in Google Slides?
üí¨ Unfortunately, no‚Ä¶ Google Slides currently does not allow you to add timed transitions to slides so they won‚Äôt automatically rotation.",,1706043464

‚úÖ Ride a camel in the desert
‚úÖ Float in the Dead Sea

""Are your students thinking in your math class? I mean REALLY thinking?

A worksheet with correct answers can mean that the student is good at repeating a procedure or memorizing, but it does not mean that they deeply understand a concept and are able to reason about it.

Here are some examples of simple shifts you can make to promote thinking and reasoning rather than mimicking.""

I am so happy to be working in a school with amazing people, continuing to support institutions and individuals with their ongoing DEI and ABAR work, and grow in my writing practice. It has been so life-giving to be in community with people every day and see and feel the impact of this work.

What will my legacy be as an ancestor to adoptees, to Korean Americans, to Jews, to queer folks who come after me?

As today marks the first day of National Adoption Awareness Month, I‚Äôm so excited to share the creation of the Soon Ok Scholarship (named after my birth mother) with the @highlightsfound an organization that has played a huge role in my growth as a writer over the past few years and opened up an entirely new and beautiful community to me. The Soon Ok Scholarship provides funds for a Transracial Adoptee Storyteller to attend an online or in-person Highlights workshop or retreat of their choice. It is funded for the next five years, and in honor of this month I would love it if folks donated to ensure its longevity.

To this day, folks often react, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look Jewish‚Äù when they learn that I am, indeed, a Jew. Confronting these stereotypes was exhausting, and I spent far too much energy defending my identity as a kid. So a few years ago I texted my dear friend and talented author Caroline the idea of co-creating a book where children throughout the multiracial, multiethnic, and multicultural Jewish community would not just see themselves in its pages, but also deepen their own understanding of Jewish peoplehood. When I (Caroline) received Liz‚Äôs text back in 2021, I was buzzing. I wondered what it would have meant as a child to read a book like the one Liz was suggesting, and what it could mean for kids today. 

Today, we are very proud to share the cover of WHAT JEWISH LOOKS LIKE, a collection of short biographies of 36 Jewish heroes, changemakers, and creatives. Whether a Cochin Jew taking the spotlight in India‚Äôs silent film industry, a trailblazing Iranian American teenage Paralympian, or an Italian neuroembryologist who fled the Nazis while secretly pursuing Nobel-prize winning discoveries, these figures are diverse in identity and experience while bound together through a shared commitment to Jewish values. Our deep hope is that this book challenges misconceptions and creates opportunities for both learning and unlearning.

A dear friend of mine used to always say, ‚ÄúBe the person you needed when you were younger.‚Äù This book is a love letter to my younger self. For the moments when I felt out of place in my family, or when I wasn‚Äôt sure what questions I wanted to ask, or how to ask them, and when I felt like the only one.
.
This is my story (as you can see from the photos on each illustrated page.) It might not be for everyone. It might disappoint adoptees who have had vastly different experiences than mine and are hoping to see themselves reflected here. I desperately wish I could create something that would meet all of our needs.
.
Sharing these snapshots of my journey doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not hurting, doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt hold onto trauma, doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt think of my birth family every day, and doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm healed. I know I am all of these things- and so much more. I don‚Äôt want these things to solely define me. Writing this book while engaging in the search for my birth parents has been cathartic, and changed the way I see myself and the world.
.
Dear @joannahowrites thank you for being a partner to me on this adventure. As happy as I am that today we can share this book with the world, I‚Äôm also sad that it‚Äôs over! And @dunghanhho, you are brilliant. Thank you for making my childhood come to life.",,1706010518

This is one of so many different adoptee experiences that need to be told. It is the story of a young girl who is raised in a loving adoptive family and who wrestles with so many challenges and unanswered questions. It is her journey of understanding that she is the only person who is able to tell her own story, that she can weave the stories she knows into the eyelets and holes of stories she doesn't, that she has the power to define her own life. 

This book releases in just a few days on Tuesday, Jan 23! Preorder today! We can't wait for you to hold it in your hands and actually get to read it and take in all of @dunghanhho's beautiful artwork.

I don‚Äôt know that anyone not in our shoes can truly understand what gay families are feeling right now because it truly sucks.

After several rounds of this, I will give them the option to stick with the case they originally chose or swap it out with one of the cases that are still remaining. Whatever is in their case is given to each group member. Because our fifth grade uses a house system, most of the cases have points behind them. I also have things like lunch with teacher, stickers, candy, and a spin from our class wheel.

I am going back to the classroom next year!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•ü•π

The banner behind me reads- ‚ÄúRemember that you once dreamed of being where you are now.‚Äù

I started teaching in 2007 and quickly realized teaching was my true passion. I spent 11 years working at various schools- both private, public, and overseas in Cairo, Egypt. Through those years I have taught Pre-K, TK, K, 1st, 2nd, 4th, & 5th. 

In my 3rd year of teaching I started @applesandabcs to share ideas and resources with teachers all over. Five years ago I had the opportunity to run @applesandabcs full time while I stayed at home with my kids. My time shifted from pouring into students to pouring into teachers. About a year ago, I felt this change inside me and I knew it was time to go back to the classroom. It was actually after presenting at my first @getyourteachon conference that I knew I was being called back to my first love- teaching the students. It has taken a year of praying and waiting to see if going back to the classroom would be what is best for me and my family.

I am THRILLED to announce that I will be teaching full time next year. The grade level announcement will need to wait until the end of August, but I can‚Äôt wait to share that with you soon. ü§ó I will still be present here online, and I would love to take you along with me on my journey back to the classroom. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•",,1722002742

Now I‚Äôm back in the classroom and a still have 900 deadlines and 900 plates spinning. But this time I have in-person coworkers and students that are starting to feel like family. I still find myself having to work at night here and there, but it really is a means to an end until I finally feel settled in my new job.

The true goal is to only be working while we are all in school. Of course there will be outlying weeks/ days‚Ä¶ but overall, I want work to be clearly defined. I‚Äôm giving myself about four more weeks to truly find balance, but I‚Äôm praying it comes quicker than that.",,1726957926

The assessments, the data gathering, the report writing, the parent teacher interviews‚Ä¶ but in amongst that one part is the excursions, the managing curriculum, still lesson planning, the whole school events, kids away with sickness, you‚Äôre sick/tired/burnt out, you‚Äôre covering lessons for other teachers‚Ä¶ term 2 is HARD! And sadly, no matter how many term 2s you‚Äôve already had, they don‚Äôt get alot easier! 

But focus on the positive! It‚Äôs nearly over. Reports are almost due, the assessments are all done, and it‚Äôs time to count down to our much deserved break! Stay focused on the end goal - sharing the positive outcomes your students have made this term, and getting some much needed REST for yourself. üñ§

Let‚Äôs face it, reports take up a huge amount of time! And most schools/departments have some pretty strict guidelines around what you can and can‚Äôt write on a report - which sometimes leaves you feeling like you haven‚Äôt said too much about the students ability, where they could really improve or how wonderful they are as a person. 

üåü The biggest thing to save time, is to write down things as you work through the term/semester. Have a spreadsheet/doc that has all your students names, and jot down a couple of points as the semester goes along. Even a word or two will help save time during the report writing process! 

üåü Keep your report comments in a word doc every semester - you‚Äôll thank yourself each time it comes to report writing for Year 9 Geography, or Year 6 Maths. The outcomes being assessed will be the same so you can use, and mould, your comments for your new class! 

But most importantly, don‚Äôt procrastinate on writing reports! Leaving it to the last minute will create a lot of undue stress and sleepless nights! Set your timeline and stick to it! You‚Äôll thank yourself!

So, what would your response be? What do YOU think makes a good teacher? 

From fellow teachers you will get very differing answers depending on what they value most in their own teaching, or in the teaching of their peers. Students will often give very similar responses if you ask them to give you an answer at the same time, however, if you ask them individually, it‚Äôs amazing what they really want. 

I did this with my class not too long before I went on leave. And it‚Äôs funny how the results didn‚Äôt shock me. They weren‚Äôt about getting them good marks, or about knowing the content, they were about being honest with them and genuinely showing that you care through listening and knowing who they are as people. 

Kids are humans too - and most of them just want to feel heard and valued. It‚Äôs amazing what you will get out of them if you give them what they need the most.

17952715160420687,3087741226875457842_59538298029,"At the start of a new term, it‚Äôs always helpful to set yourself some teaching goals to provide focus and direction for the term. And with so many preservice teachers doing placements this term, it‚Äôs critical to have focus or you‚Äôll try to do everything. 

Setting yourself goals can help you to stop trying to do everything in the classroom, and allow you to focus on the things you‚Äôve deemed important! 

Your goals may look like:
- differentiating work for ‚Äòstudent‚Äô 
- focusing on developing paragraph structure 
- collaboration to encourage team work skills 
- only one extra-curricular activity 

Having focus allows you to address the needs of your kids and to see progress. If we do something consistently, it promotes change and growth. And it makes it so much easier to assess progress. 

What are your goals/focus for Term 2?

We know the first few years of teaching are tough! We know there is so much that your university degree doesn‚Äôt prepare you for! And we know that sometimes, there isn‚Äôt the support you need coming from your mentor or school. 

We want to know what have been your biggest challenges, where you needed support, and what you wished your university degree had prepared you for!

One great way of doing this is to set your goals and boundaries. What do you want to achieve in the classroom and for yourself? Where are you spending time that you feel isn‚Äôt serving you to make you happier or more productive? 

For our beginning teachers, you may need to put further boundaries in place to not take so much work home (delete your work email from your phone!!), or to give yourself free afternoons and a free Saturday and plan for the week on a Sunday. 

For pre-service teachers, you may be going into your placements or internship. This can be scary, stressful and overwhelming. Make sure you set a consistent routine (which includes a daily dose of exercise/downtime) to ensure you don‚Äôt get overworked, and feel like your drowning! And ask for help! Every teacher started somewhere and they want to help. Never feel like you‚Äôre in this alone ü§ç

Term Two is busy, and stressful. Do what you can now to ensure that it‚Äôs as smooth as possible!",,1682131860
17924269247691871,3086243594579569556_59538298029,"I remember when I first started teaching, I was thrown in the deep end with two Year 12 classes. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and I had 25 kids futures now riding on me being able to do my job without ever stepping foot in a classroom before. 

It was stressful, anxiety inducing, and definitely pushed me way out of my comfort zone. 

While I had some support, most of my first year (well, the first 5 years!) was me floundering, being a lesson ahead, and feeling like I was still on the same unknown path I‚Äôd been the year before. 

After that experience, it makes sense to me why so many teachers leave the profession in the first five years of teaching. And it makes me worry even more before universities are NOT providing the necessary training to ensure teachers are prepared when stepping foot into the classroom. 

After years and years now in the system, it‚Äôs time to do something about encouraging the right candidates to begin a teaching degree and for those pre-service and beginning teachers to get the help they require in the classroom! (And maybe even bringing back some of that passion for experienced teachers who are ready to leave!). 

Big things need to change!

Sotomayor‚Äôs life story and words will inspire so many readers. The part I‚Äôm excited to share with students is how comic books helped her deal with life!
Sonya was diagnosed with diabetes at a young age and she used the characters in comic books to find her courage to face her daily treatments.

This year, I‚Äôm using Everyday Math as my core curriculum. It‚Äôs totally new to me, and so is teaching geometry at the beginning of the school year. I wanted to get a bit creative with teaching polygons and parallelograms, so when I found the parallelogram club (2nd picture), I knew I had to make it even broader! We learned about the very exclusive private polygon school, the quadrilateral class within it, and the ultra-exclusive parallelogram club. My 4th graders LOVED this, and it was the perfect visual for them (and also great for talking about how those poor outsiders felt üòâ)! If I had to do it again, I would have made my school larger so that I could fit the names of all the shapes in.

Our writing offices are getting put to good use this week! üììWe are learning all about revising and making our writing more interesting this week! After I stapled the file folders together, each student put their own writing office together and made it their own. Throughout the process of assembling we talked about what each page was for so they know how to use their office as a tool to help their writing!

We show up everyday‚Ä¶ even when we are not our 100%. Sometimes it‚Äôs just easier to go in then plan a days worth of supply plans.

Hey Teach ‚úåüèº ‚úèÔ∏è 

Tash and Kris here from @theteacherpath with another Tip Tuesday!

If you‚Äôre anything like us, some of those essential classroom items can dwindle‚Ä¶like a LOT‚Ä¶this time of year. Despite our best efforts, pencils can be a hot commodity! 

This funky contraption has been another game changer the last few years to help keep those pencils in one place. Students LOVE the novelty of it at first but really appreciate that in order to hit the button and get a pencil, that there must BE pencils in the container and are much more likely to return their pencils. 

One of our student jobs is to sharpen pencils and ensure that the container is full. If we are at those time of the year when pencils are getting pretty short, they can be replaced, of course, but this has slowed down the cases of missing pencils around the class! 

This straw dispenser can also be adjusted to dispense the larger Primary pencils as well as your regular HB. It‚Äôs been such a hit that we‚Äôve bought them for our own kids‚Äô teachers too!

Interested? Here‚Äôs the link to get one of your own!

Come on a little tour to check out our classroom zen zone!

We can‚Äôt be ready to learn unless all of our needs are met. That‚Äôs a fact of life. If our students aren‚Äôt feeling comfortable, they won‚Äôt be prepared to learn. Sometimes a little reset helps. 

Giving students an opportunity to realize they need a moment to become ready is important and even though it may take 5 minutes out of their learning, if they don‚Äôt have that chance, it may result in far more than 5 minutes wasted! 

Simple little additions to the classroom and explicit instructions that students must follow when in the Zen Zone has made this a game changer for students who have struggled in the past with behaviours.

‚ú® Classroom Management can be a daunting subject‚Ä¶ however over the years there has been a couple tools in our toolbox that we have kept consistent throughout the year. 

‚úîÔ∏è Timers (transitions and visuals) 
‚úîÔ∏è Doorbells! This is a great tool especially one you can incorporate different strategies like ‚ÄúKnock Knock‚Äù (teacher says) ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs There?‚Äù 
‚úîÔ∏è Rewards systems (these can get expensive and often time loose the stamina as the school year goes) 
 ‚ú®Desk Pets (super fun and you can add holiday theme items in them to surprise the kids) different accessories they can add add as a reward, maker station to get creative, or even a writing piece for language) 
‚ú® Stickers are always a huge hit! 
‚úîÔ∏è Non- Negotiable Tool that expectations are easily understood my a visual cue.
 ‚ú®For me it is my DUCK HAT‚Ä¶ when this hat is on 
  The students know that I am busy working with 
  Students (assessing, group work or 
  conferencing) 
‚ÄºÔ∏è My hat changes with the seasons, but it has been a lot of fun to implement and has the kids smiling üôÇ 

Comment below ‚¨áÔ∏è and share your classroom tips and tricks! We would love to hear your ideas!

I can‚Äôt be the only one, right? RIGHT?!

‚úåüèºTash and Kris here from the Teacher Path!

‚ú®Teaching is one of the only professions where it takes way more work to take a day off than going to work, especially when you have multiple classes or grades and need to differentiate for everyone! 

‚ú®When you aren‚Äôt feeling well, or have something going on that should be the forefront of your mind, this just causes more stress! 

‚úîÔ∏èWe are working on a package for contract teachers to ease that stress and for Occasional Teachers to have on hand  in case of emergencies. 

‚úîÔ∏èWhat are some items you‚Äôd like to have on hand all the time ‚Äòjust in case‚Äô but don‚Äôt have time to put together yourself?

Our profession is anything but static so it is imperative that we stay updated with the research in the field of education. This article was published in 2019 and authors Eric Chiang and Albert Sumell studied the effectiveness of mindfulness practices in the classroom. They found that with the implementation of mindfulness practices in school, there was an improvement in student performance. This just goes to show that not only can mindfulness practices help with students‚Äô social-emotional development, it can also impact their academic performance.

It entails certain qualities in the affected student that act as their strengths (such as higher levels of curiosity, creativity, empathy, enthusiasm, and energy) as well as some that pose challenges to their learning (such as inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity). Now it is one thing to be able to read that description of students with ADHD and it‚Äôs a WHOLE NEW thing to experience being in their shoes first hand. Only when we experience their struggle with the previously mentioned challenges first-hand are we able to truly cater to their learning needs. That‚Äôs why the simulation I mentioned earlier is so great. It really brings to life everything we read about ADHD and makes an impression on the way we conduct our classes. Happy teaching! ‚Ä¢

Integrating this understanding into our teaching philosophy can reconceptualize how we perceive challenging behaviours. More often than not, students want to listen attentively during your lessons, they want to get along with their classmates, and they want to succeed in your class. The reason they exhibit challenging behaviours instead of this might be because they are lagging or lacking in the skills required to do so. In other words, if they have these skills, they *CAN* do well. Consider this; I may *want* to be a doctor, but I cannot do this because I am lacking the skills required. If I acquire these skills, I *CAN* be a doctor. Are you helping your students develop the skills they NEED so they CAN do well?. Happy Teaching!

The article that is mentioned in the second photo of this post (swipe left) is one that reiterates the importance of teaching multimodal literacy to the students of the 21st century. It is also a great resource particularly for junior-level teachers. Whenever a new teaching practice emerges, teachers find it hard to implement because it may be unfamiliar to them. This article is wonderful because it makes reference to the usefulness of graphic novels/comic books in facilitating multimodal literacy development in a fun way. The article summarizes three graphic novels that students in the past have responded well to and provides SPECIFIC ways in which these multimodal texts can be used to invoke an analytical lens in the students reading them. This could help you kickstart or revive the development of multimodal literacies in your students and really get them thinking! As well, you might want to have your students engage in the composition of their own graphic novels! (Swipe left again for sample work) Provide lots of colour mediums, paper, and as much creative freedom as you can spare, and watch the wheels turn!
